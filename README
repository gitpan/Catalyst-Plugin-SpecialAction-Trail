NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::SpecialAction::Trail - Support for the 'trail' special
    action

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      # enabling the 'trail' special action in a single controller:

      package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

      use Moose;
      use namespace::autoclean;

      extends 'Catalyst::Controller';

      with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::SpecialAction::Trail';

      sub trail : Private {
        my ($self, $c, @args) = (shift, shift, @_);

        ...
      }

      # globally enabling the 'trail' special action:

      package MyApp;

      use Moose;
      use namespace::autoclean;

      extends 'Catalyst';

      __PACKAGE__->setup(qw/ SpecialAction::Trail /);

      # now you can use 'trail' in any controller in your app

DESCRIPTION
    This module introduces a new special action "trail" that unites the
    features of "end" and "auto" special actions (see "Built-in special
    actions" in Catalyst::Manual::Intro):

    *   Like "end", the "trail" actions will be run at the end of the
        request, after all URL-matching actions are called; but they are
        called before any "end" is run.

    *   Like "auto", multiple "trail" actions will be run in turn, starting
        with the application class and going through to the most specific
        controller class, and the processing chain stops if any of them
        returns false (any remaining "trail" actions are skipped and the
        control goes to "end" if there's any).

METHODS
  setup_component
    Overridden (with an 'around' method modifier) from "setup_component" in
    Catalyst. Applies the
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::SpecialAction::Trail role to the
    "Catalyst::Controller" instance.

SEE ALSO
